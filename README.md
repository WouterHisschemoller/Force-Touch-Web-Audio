# Force Touch Web Audio
Force Touch browser test. One button, the harder you press, the higher the tone.

This is a simple Javascript app to test Apple's Force Touch technology. Since a few weeks I have an iPhone 6s, so I can now try it out.

## Overview
The app just shows one big button on the centre of the page. The harder you press the button, the higher frequency tone is produced. The button changes in colour and size too.
